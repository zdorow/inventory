# inventory
Script for calculation of inventory

NOTE: It does not need to be accumulated using an array you can just use accumlator variables

Write two programs which will work with a structure.

a) The first program will use a structure to store the following inventory data in a file:

Item Description
Quantity on Hand
Wholesale Cost
Retail Cost
Date Added to Inventory
The program will write five records to an output file for different items; the quantity, costs, and date for each item will be different from the other items.

b) The second program will read the file created by the first program using the same structure. The second program will calculate and display the following information:

total wholesale value of the inventory
total retail value of the inventory
total quantity of all items in the inventory
